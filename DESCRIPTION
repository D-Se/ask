Title: Ternary Question Operator
Description: Combine if-then-not ('?', '~', '!') to unify 'if', 'ifelse', 'is',
          'as', 'stopifnot' and documentation search. Elegant, terse, yet fast,
          the ternary question optimizes thought-to-code and code-to-thought, and
          embraces the chain of questions and answers for unprecedented ease-of-use.
